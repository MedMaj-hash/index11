    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the presentation of a web page written in HTML or XML. 
        It controls the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall appearance of the elements on the page. 
        CSS allows web designers to separate the content (HTML) from the visual presentation, making it easier to maintain and update the design.
        By using CSS, you can style multiple web pages at once by linking to a common stylesheet, providing consistency across the site.
