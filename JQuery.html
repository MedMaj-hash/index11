    <h2>What is jQuery?</h2>
    <p>
        jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It simplifies things like HTML document traversal, event handling, 
        animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. With jQuery, developers can write less code to accomplish common JavaScript tasks, 
        which makes it easier to create interactive and dynamic websites. 
        Although jQuery was widely used in the past, modern JavaScript frameworks and browser improvements have reduced its reliance today.
