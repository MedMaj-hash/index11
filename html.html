    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages. 
        It is a markup language that structures content on the web, such as text, images, links, tables, and forms. 
        HTML uses tags to describe elements on a webpage. These tags define the structure and layout of the content. 
        It is the backbone of most websites and is used in combination with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to 
        create fully functional and styled web pages.
