    <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. 
        It enables web developers to add features like animations, forms, real-time updates, and other interactive elements to web pages. 
        JavaScript can run in the browser, allowing web pages to respond to user actions without reloading the page. 
        It is commonly used alongside HTML and CSS to build modern, responsive web applications.
